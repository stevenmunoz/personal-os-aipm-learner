# Steven:Divya - Review Session 1

Fri, 13 Feb 26 · divya.sabade@gmail.com

### Product Inspiration Analysis

- Reviewed Mymind app as primary inspiration
  - Excellent onboarding experience with magical feel
  - No ads, no social features → subscription-first model ($7 minimum)
  - Auto-tagging and organization as core value prop
  - Strong manifesto and opinionated positioning
- Key differentiator: they're building "coming soon" features we're already conceptualizing
  - Horizontal approach (writers, researchers, general users)
  - Our vertical focus on AI PMs creates defensible moat

### Cold Start Problem Solutions

- Import browser history automatically if possible
  - Pre-populate with bookmarks, Medium articles, YouTube videos
  - Show immediate value: "Here are 10 articles we've organized for you"
- LinkedIn login for persona-based content curation
  - Pre-curated content for PMs vs engineers vs other roles
  - Different AI learning paths based on profile
- Fallback: curated content for users who don't want to share data
  - Goal-based recommendations
  - Sample articles/videos to demonstrate extension value

### Onboarding Flow Strategy

- Step 1: Magical first impression (inspired by Mymind's approach)
- Step 2: Goal definition + timeline setting
- Step 3: Critical friction point - getting user information
  - Primary path: share existing content for processing
  - Backup path: curated recommendations based on goals
- Aha moment: "This is your learning path based on your goals"
  - Show organized content connected to specific objectives
  - Demonstrate immediate value before asking for commitment

### Vertical Differentiation Strategy

- Target AI PM upskilling specifically (not interview prep for MVP)
  - Validated by course demographics - majority want to upskill at current companies
  - Less complex than interview simulation (no rubrics, SMEs, human evaluators needed)
- Four key backend focus areas:
  1. Performance infrastructure (recall, explanation, gap detection)
  2. Vertical depth (AI PM-specific pain points and solutions)
  3. Intent-driven personalization (different goals = different experiences)
  4. Personal readiness scoring (capability building vs consumption)

### Concept Graph Evolution

- Transform nodes concept into tree/growth metaphor
  - More engaging than traditional lesson completion
  - Visual progress: planting seeds → growing branches → full trees
  - Multiple trees = mastery across different AI domains
- Connected to learning goals rather than standalone organization
  - Master graph with sub-graphs for different intents
  - Clear connection between saved content and skill development

### User Experience Philosophy

- Emotional positioning: calm confidence vs anxious overwhelm
  - "You're in control" messaging
  - Structured learning path reduces decision paralysis
- Address core pain point: people invest in courses but don't digest material
  - System tracks actual learning vs consumption
  - Gap analysis and recommendations for incomplete learning
- Retention through growth visualization and achievement feeling

### Technical Implementation Plan

- Monday: New prototype iteration incorporating feedback
  - Enhanced onboarding flow
  - Tree concept integration
  - Goal + timeline definition
- Branching system for version comparison (v1 vs v2)
- Local development setup for Divya to start experimenting
- Production pipeline planning once requirements solidified

### Next Steps

- Steven: Build v2 prototype with improved onboarding and tree concept by Monday
- Steven: Research browser history import feasibility for Chrome extension
- Steven: Set up branching system and teach Divya local development
- Divya: Review new prototype before Monday 4pm meeting
- Both: Finalize persona validation (upskilling vs job-seeking focus)
- Both: Compare v1 vs v2 prototypes and iterate toward production-ready version
