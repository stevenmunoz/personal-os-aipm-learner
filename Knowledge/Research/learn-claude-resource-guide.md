# Learn Claude — Complete Learning Guide

**Source:** https://sara-kukovec.github.io/Learn-Claude/
**GitHub:** https://github.com/sara-kukovec/Learn-Claude
**Added:** 2026-02-18
**Relevance:** AI fluency for PMs, prompt/context engineering, agent design patterns

## Overview
Curated guide with 11 sections covering Claude from beginner to advanced. Every entry links to original sources (Anthropic docs, courses, tutorials).

## Structure

### LEARN (Progressive Levels)
1. **Level 1 — Use Claude:** Daily tasks, writing, research, structured thinking
   - Claude 101 (Anthropic Academy, free + certificate)
   - AI Fluency: Framework & Foundations
   - Projects, Artifacts, prompt engineering interactive tutorial
   - Coursera 3-course series (with Anthropic + AWIT)
   - Use Case Guides (support tickets, content moderation, summarization)

2. **Level 2 — Build with Claude:** API integration, custom applications
   - (Developer-focused resources)

3. **Level 3 — Design Agents:** Agentic patterns, autonomous workflows
   - (Advanced agent architecture)

### UNDERSTAND
- **Prompt Engineering** — techniques for consistent outputs
- **Context Engineering** — managing context windows effectively
- **Agent Environments** — runtime patterns for agents

### EXPLORE
- **Tools & Platforms** — ecosystem around Claude

### PRACTICE
- **Claude Code** — agentic coding tool
- **Cowork** — collaborative patterns
- **Skills** — reusable agent capabilities
- **7 Steps to Fluency** — structured learning path

## Why This Matters for Upstream

### Direct Parallels
| Learn-Claude | Upstream | Connection |
|-------------|----------|------------|
| 3 skill tiers (Use → Build → Agents) | Intent-based onboarding paths | Same progressive model — we personalize it |
| 7 Steps to Fluency | Growth Tree visualization | Both map learning milestones, ours is interactive |
| 140+ curated resources by level | Content seeding (StepContentSeeding) | Their dataset could bootstrap our initial content library |
| Concepts (Prompt → Context → Agent) | Path evolution within a single user journey | We track this progression dynamically per user |
| Chrome extension for capture | Our Chrome extension (bookmark + tag) | Similar capture-to-learn model |

### What They Have That We Don't (Opportunities)
- **Expert network (60+ voices)** → Community mentors / guest content feature
- **Separate UNDERSTAND vs PRACTICE sections** → Our app blends theory and practice; consider conceptual separation
- **Static simplicity** → Zero friction, no login — good for top-of-funnel discovery

### What We Have That They Don't (Our Edge)
- **Personalization by intent** — they're one-size-fits-all, we adapt
- **Readiness Score** — dynamic, not a static checklist
- **Interactive Growth Tree** — visual progress, not just a numbered list
- **Today's Focus dashboard** — daily actionable guidance
- **Multi-path system** — users can pursue multiple learning goals simultaneously

### Actionable Ideas
1. Use their 140+ resource links as seed data for our content library (with proper attribution)
2. Map their "7 Steps" to our Growth Tree nodes as a Claude-specific learning path template
3. Their expert network list = potential outreach targets for community features
4. Their evolution model (Prompts → Context → Agents) could become a default path template for "AI-first PM" intent
