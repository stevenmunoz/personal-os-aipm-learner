**Added:** 2026-02-18
**Relevance:** AI fluency for PMs, prompt/context engineering, agent design patterns

## Overview
Curated guide with 11 sections covering Claude from beginner to advanced. Every entry links to original sources (Anthropic docs, courses, tutorials).

## Structure

### LEARN (Progressive Levels)
1. **Level 1 — Use Claude:** Daily tasks, writing, research, structured thinking
   - Claude 101 (Anthropic Academy, free + certificate)
   - AI Fluency: Framework & Foundations
   - Projects, Artifacts, prompt engineering interactive tutorial
   - Coursera 3-course series (with Anthropic + AWIT)
   - Use Case Guides (support tickets, content moderation, summarization)

2. **Level 2 — Build with Claude:** API integration, custom applications
   - (Developer-focused resources)

3. **Level 3 — Design Agents:** Agentic patterns, autonomous workflows
   - (Advanced agent architecture)

### UNDERSTAND
- **Prompt Engineering** — techniques for consistent outputs
- **Context Engineering** — managing context windows effectively
- **Agent Environments** — runtime patterns for agents

### EXPLORE
- **Tools & Platforms** — ecosystem around Claude

### PRACTICE
- **Claude Code** — agentic coding tool
- **Cowork** — collaborative patterns
- **Skills** — reusable agent capabilities
- **7 Steps to Fluency** — structured learning path

## Why This Matters for Upstream
- Our target users (PMs) need exactly this kind of structured AI learning
- The progressive level structure (Use → Build → Design) mirrors our onboarding intent model
- Content seeding in our app could reference/complement these official resources
- The "7 Steps to Fluency" framework could inform our readiness score methodology
