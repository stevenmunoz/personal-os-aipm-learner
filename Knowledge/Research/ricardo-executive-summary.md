# Ricardo Interview - Executive Summary

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Participant:** Ricardo (AI Agent's Product Manager at TENZC)
**Framework:** Teresa Torres' Continuous Discovery Habits

---

## TL;DR (1 Minute Read)

**Who Ricardo Is:**
- AI PM at TENZC (B2B fintech compliance agents)
- CS degree + MBA at Berkeley
- Self-motivated learner (watches AI content daily, reads papers)
- **Learner Type:** Autonomous (prefers independence over hand-holding)

**Course Impact:**
- ✅ Using Cursor/Claude Code **daily** in AI PM role
- ✅ Can create PRs, diagnose latency issues, ask questions to codebase
- ✅ Successfully bridging product-engineering communication gap
- Quote: "The course was really helpful for me. I got a lot out of it, and I am really applying it in the way that I'm using my job now."

**Key Pain Points:**
1. **Technical Setup Process** - Prefers written steps sent in advance, not live walkthroughs
2. **Session Agenda Clarity** - Found it "a little confusing" what each session would cover
3. **Technical Blocker (CRITICAL)** - AI Trip Planner OpenAI API never worked, eventually abandoned

---

## Top 3 Insights for Aman

### 1. Technical Blocker Abandonment = Silent Dropoff Risk
**What Happened:**
- Ricardo's AI Trip Planner OpenAI integration never worked
- Quote: "For some reason, I would never get the freaking OpenAI results from the call"
- Had to choose: debug course project vs. focus on work transition
- **NEVER RESOLVED** - abandoned the project completely

**Why This Matters:**
- Students will deprioritize course when work conflicts arise
- No clear blocker resolution pathway = silent student dropoff
- Lost learning opportunity (debugging skills, troubleshooting)

**Recommended Fix:**
- **P0:** Implement Technical Blocker Triage System
  - #technical-help Slack channel (TA monitors daily)
  - "Known Issues" docs for each project (prevent Ricardo's issue for future students)
  - Weekly "Bring Your Blocker" office hours
  - 24-hour TA response SLA

### 2. Learner Personas: One-Size-Fits-All Support Doesn't Work
**Discovery:**
Ricardo represents a **different learner type** than Mike:

| Dimension | Mike (Guided Learner) | Ricardo (Autonomous Learner) |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Background** | Can learn tech, needs structure | CS degree, prefers independence |
| **Setup Preference** | Benefits from walkthroughs | "Just give me all the steps" |
| **Pain Point** | Going too deep without guardrails | Live walkthroughs feel slow |
| **Support Style** | "Show me how" | "Let me do it myself" |
| **Value From TA** | Project scoping, accountability | Fast async support, pre-emptive docs |

**Why This Matters:**
- Current course serves one persona well but frustrates the other
- Ricardo: "It's hard to follow" when Aman does "click by click and bottom by bottom in front of me"
- Both types exist in every cohort - need dual approach

**Recommended Fix:**
- **P0:** Create Dual-Format Materials
  - "Quick Start Guide" (autonomous learners) - just the steps, no fluff
  - "Detailed Walkthrough" (guided learners) - step-by-step with screenshots
  - Let students choose their path

---

### 3. Setup Friction is UNIVERSAL (Confirmed 2/2 Students)
**Evidence:**
- Mike: "Getting started was the most difficult part"
- Ricardo: "If there is technical stuff to set up before a section, just give me all the steps"
- **Status:** ✅ CONFIRMED across both interviews

**Ricardo's Specific Feedback:**
- Send setup steps **2-3 days in advance** (not day-of)
- Prefers doing setup independently before class
- Quote: "I'd rather just do it all myself"

**Recommended Fix:**
- **P0:** Pre-Course/Pre-Session Setup Protocol
  - Send setup checklists 2-3 days before sessions
  - Include troubleshooting guide
  - Offer optional setup office hours (for guided learners)
  - Dual format: Quick Start + Detailed versions

---

## Cross-Interview Pattern Analysis

### ✅ CONFIRMED (2/2 Students)
- **Setup friction is universal pain point** (Mike + Ricardo)
- **Course delivers real career value** (both using tools daily in jobs)

### ⏳ EMERGING (Needs Validation)
- **Technical blocker support gap** (Ricardo abandoned project)
- **Learner personas require different support** (Mike vs. Ricardo contrast)

### ❌ NOT UNIVERSAL
- **"Going too deep too soon"** - Mike experienced this, Ricardo did NOT mention
  - **Hypothesis:** This may be learner-dependent (guided vs. autonomous)

### ❓ NEEDS VALIDATION
- **Session agenda clarity** - Ricardo mentioned, need to check with Evelyn/Divya
- **EU timezone challenges** - Mike mentioned, Ricardo did not

## Updated Prioritization: Top 3 Quick Wins for Aman

Based on 2 interviews (Mike + Ricardo), here are the **highest-impact, evidence-backed improvements**:

### 🔴 P0 Priority 1: Technical Blocker Triage System
**Why P0:**
- High impact (prevents student dropoff)
- High evidence (Ricardo case study)
- Medium effort (requires TA infrastructure)

**What to Build:**
1. #technical-help Slack channel
2. "Known Issues" doc per project (start with AI Trip Planner)
3. Weekly "Bring Your Blocker" office hours
4. TA 24-hour response SLA

**Expected Impact:** 30%+ increase in project completion rate

---

### 🔴 P0 Priority 2: Dual-Format Setup Materials
**Why P0:**
- High impact (reduces friction for all learner types)
- High evidence (Mike + Ricardo confirm different needs)
- Medium effort (2x documentation work)

**What to Build:**
1. "Quick Start Guide" (for Ricardo-type autonomous learners)
2. "Detailed Walkthrough" (for Mike-type guided learners)
3. Let students choose their preferred format

**Expected Impact:** Higher satisfaction across all learner types

---

### 🔴 P0 Priority 3: Pre-Course/Pre-Session Setup Week
**Why P0:**
- High impact (removes #1 barrier to entry)
- High evidence (2/2 students mentioned)
- Low effort (checklist + doc)

**What to Build:**
1. Send setup checklists 2-3 days before sessions (not day-of)
2. Include troubleshooting guide
3. Optional setup office hours
4. Verification tests ("setup working? here's how to check")

**Expected Impact:** 50%+ reduction in setup time during live sessions

---

## TA Value Proposition (Strengthened)

Ricardo's interview adds **new dimensions** to TA value:

### What Ricardo Would Value from a TA:
1. **Fast async blocker support** (24-hour Slack responses)
2. **Pre-emptive documentation** (known issues, troubleshooting)
3. **Clear escalation path** (when to ask for help)
4. **Advanced resources** (for students who want to go deeper)
5. **Engineering communication tips** (bridge product-engineering gap)

### Updated TA Role Definition:
**TA = Multi-Persona Support Specialist**
- Serves both autonomous learners (Ricardo) and guided learners (Mike)
- Prevents silent dropoff through proactive blocker triage
- Creates dual-format materials for different learning styles
- Builds knowledge base to scale support over time

---

## Next Research Actions

### For Evelyn Interview:
1. **Validate setup friction** (3/3 confirmation?)
2. **Test persona hypothesis** - Does she prefer written docs or live walkthroughs?
3. **Check for blocker abandonment** - Any projects she gave up on?
4. **Validate session clarity** - Did she find agendas confusing?

### For Divya Interview:
1. Same validation questions as Evelyn
2. Evals-specific deep dive (her primary focus)
3. Check if evals teaching had blocker issues
