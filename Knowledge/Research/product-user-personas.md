# AI PM Learning Tool - User Personas & Journey Maps

**Product:** AI PM Content Aggregation & Learning Path Tool
**Date:** January 23, 2026
**Created By:** Steven Muñoz & Divya Sabade
**Evidence Source:** Student research calls (Mike, Ricardo, Evelyn) + Market analysis

---

## Problem Statement

AI PM learners encounter valuable content across multiple platforms (LinkedIn, Medium, YouTube, newsletters, course materials) but lack a systematic way to organize, retrieve, and learn from this content when needed. They save content with good intentions but rarely revisit it, leading to:
- **Content graveyard** - 100+ saved posts never read
- **Overwhelm** - Too much content, no clear path
- **Missed opportunities** - Can't find relevant material when preparing for interviews or building projects
- **Inefficient learning** - Consuming content without retention or application

---

## Persona 1: The Career Transitioner

### Profile

**Name:** Alex Chen (Mike's archetype)
**Age:** 32
**Background:**
- Current: Product Manager at traditional company (5 years PM experience)
- Education: Business degree
- Technical level: Can learn technical concepts but not a developer
- Location: Mid-tier city, European timezone

**Current Situation:**
- Preparing for AI-native PM roles at companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, Cursor
- Taking AI PM courses (spent $2,500 on courses in past year)
- Following 50+ AI thought leaders on LinkedIn
- Consuming 10-15 hours of AI content per week
- **Problem:** Can't keep up with pace of AI, feels behind despite consuming lots of content

**Quote (from research):**
> "When we go to LinkedIn, I save the post, and sometimes I never read it, but I want it because it was important, it was something valuable. Maybe I saved that image or link."

---

### Goals & Motivations

**Primary Goal:** Land AI PM role at AI-native company within 3 months

**Supporting Goals:**
1. **Interview Readiness:** Demonstrate AI-native workflows and thinking in interviews
2. **Build Portfolio:** Ship 1-2 AI products to show capability
3. **Stay Current:** Understand latest AI developments (agents, evals, RAG, etc.)
4. **Network Smart:** Connect with right people in AI PM space

**Motivations:**
- Fear of being left behind in traditional PM roles
- Excitement about building with AI
- Financial: AI PM roles pay 20-30% more
- Career growth: AI is the future of product management

**Success Metrics:**
- Pass AI PM interviews at 3+ companies
- Ship working AI product that impresses interviewers
- Demonstrate fluency in AI concepts without sounding fake

---

### Current Behavior (Without Product)

**Content Consumption Pattern:**
- **Morning:** Scroll LinkedIn (30 min), save 3-5 posts
- **Commute:** Listen to AI podcasts (Lenny, a16z, etc.)
- **Lunch:** Read Substack newsletters (5-10 subscribed)
- **Evening:** Course work or YouTube tutorials (1-2 hours)
- **Weekend:** Catch up on saved content (rarely happens)

**Tools Currently Used:**
- LinkedIn "Save" feature (87 saved posts, never organized)
- Notion (random notes, no structure)
- Browser bookmarks (200+, never revisited)
- Course platforms (3 active courses, 40% completion)
- Medium "Reading List" (50+ articles)

**Pain Points:**
1. **Content Overload** - Saves 20+ items per week, reads 2-3
2. **No Organization** - Everything in one big pile
3. **Can't Find Content** - "I know I saved something about agents..."
4. **Context Switching** - Content spread across 5+ platforms
5. **No Learning Path** - Random consumption, no progression
6. **Imposter Syndrome** - Consumes a lot but can't articulate what they know

- Technical level: Can read code, build prototypes with AI tools
- Location: Bay Area, works at mid-stage startup

**Current Situation:**
- Already working in AI PM role but needs to stay current
- Shipping AI features quarterly
- Learning by building (prototypes, side projects)
- Follows AI research (reads papers on weekends)
- **Problem:** Learning is reactive (learns when blocked) rather than proactive

---

### Current Behavior (Without Product)

**Learning Pattern:**
- **Reactive learning:** Encounters blocker → Google → Stack Overflow → Trial/error
- **Passive collection:** Saves interesting content "for later" (rarely revisits)
- **Weekend deep dives:** Tries to catch up on saved content (inconsistent)
- **Course fatigue:** Started 3 courses, finished 0 (too broad, not targeted)

**Tools Currently Used:**
- Notion (messy, 100+ pages, hard to search)
- Browser bookmarks (by date, not topic)
- Twitter/X saved posts (design patterns, code snippets)
- GitHub stars (repos to try "someday")
- Slack saved messages (from engineering team)

**Pain Points:**
1. **Can't find solutions when blocked** - "I know I saved something about this..."
2. **Learning inefficiency** - Consumes content without clear application
3. **Context scattered** - Work notes ≠ learning notes ≠ side project notes
4. **No structured growth** - Random learning, no clear progression
5. **Imposter syndrome** - Feels like everyone else knows more

- Go back to "just scrolling" (not saving or learning)

**Friction Points:**
- 🔴 **Lost momentum** - Initial excitement gone
- 🔴 **No progress** - Consumed a lot, built nothing
- 🔴 **Isolation** - No peers at same level

**Outcome:**
- ❌ Abandons AI PM learning
- 😞 "AI is too hard" or "Not for me"

## Product Implications

### Core Features (All Personas Need)

1. **Multi-Source Aggregation**
   - Save from LinkedIn, Medium, YouTube, Twitter, Notion, Slack, GitHub
   - Browser extension + integrations

2. **AI-Powered Organization**
   - Automatic topic clustering (agents, evals, RAG, etc.)
   - Semantic deduplication (same concept from different sources)
   - Summarization (extract key concepts)

3. **Intent-Based Retrieval**
   - "Show me content for [interview prep / building feature / learning topic]"
   - Time-aware ("I have 2 weeks")
   - Proficiency-aware ("I'm intermediate")

4. **Learning Path Generation**
   - Personalized curriculum from saved content
   - Progressive depth (beginner → advanced)
   - Application-focused (theory + practice)

---

### Persona-Specific Features

**For Alex (Career Transitioner):**
- Interview simulator (practice mode)
- Gap analysis ("You know agents but weak on evals")
- Strategic sparring partner (challenge thinking)
- Time-boxed paths (2 weeks, 1 month)

**For Priya (Continuous Builder):**
- Context-aware search (tech stack, constraints)
- Quick retrieval (fast access when blocked)
- Implementation templates (code snippets)
- Skill tree tracking (visual progress)

**For Jordan (Aspiring Specialist):**
- Beginner-friendly onboarding
- Structured 6-month roadmap
- Project milestones (hands-on learning)
- Peer matching (community)
- Progress gamification (streaks, badges)

## Next Steps: Validation

### Key Assumptions to Test

1. **Will users actually save content consistently?**
   - Test: Track save frequency in beta
   - Assumption: Users save 5+ items per week
   - Risk: Low adoption if saving isn't habit

2. **Can AI summarization capture nuance?**
   - Test: Show summaries to 10 users, measure accuracy
   - Assumption: 80%+ of key concepts captured
   - Risk: Users don't trust summaries, go back to original

3. **Do personalized learning paths work better than generic?**
   - Test: A/B test personalized vs generic paths
   - Assumption: 2x higher completion rate
   - Risk: Personalization complexity not worth effort

4. **Will users actually follow intent-based paths?**
   - Test: Track path completion for "interview in 2 weeks"
   - Assumption: 60%+ complete suggested path
   - Risk: Users start path but abandon
