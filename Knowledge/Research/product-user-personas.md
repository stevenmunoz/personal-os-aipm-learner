# AI PM Learning Tool - User Personas & Journey Maps

**Product:** AI PM Content Aggregation & Learning Path Tool
**Date:** January 23, 2026
**Created By:** Steven Muñoz & Divya Sabade
**Evidence Source:** Student research calls (Mike, Ricardo, Evelyn) + Market analysis

---

## Problem Statement

AI PM learners encounter valuable content across multiple platforms (LinkedIn, Medium, YouTube, newsletters, course materials) but lack a systematic way to organize, retrieve, and learn from this content when needed. They save content with good intentions but rarely revisit it, leading to:
- **Content graveyard** - 100+ saved posts never read
- **Overwhelm** - Too much content, no clear path
- **Missed opportunities** - Can't find relevant material when preparing for interviews or building projects
- **Inefficient learning** - Consuming content without retention or application

---

## Persona 1: The Career Transitioner

### Profile

**Name:** Alex Chen (Mike's archetype)
**Age:** 32
**Background:**
- Current: Product Manager at traditional company (5 years PM experience)
- Education: Business degree
- Technical level: Can learn technical concepts but not a developer
- Location: Mid-tier city, European timezone

**Current Situation:**
- Preparing for AI-native PM roles at companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, Cursor
- Taking AI PM courses (spent $2,500 on courses in past year)
- Following 50+ AI thought leaders on LinkedIn
- Consuming 10-15 hours of AI content per week
- **Problem:** Can't keep up with pace of AI, feels behind despite consuming lots of content

**Quote (from research):**
> "When we go to LinkedIn, I save the post, and sometimes I never read it, but I want it because it was important, it was something valuable. Maybe I saved that image or link."

## Next Steps: Validation

### Key Assumptions to Test

1. **Will users actually save content consistently?**
   - Test: Track save frequency in beta
   - Assumption: Users save 5+ items per week
   - Risk: Low adoption if saving isn't habit

2. **Can AI summarization capture nuance?**
   - Test: Show summaries to 10 users, measure accuracy
   - Assumption: 80%+ of key concepts captured
   - Risk: Users don't trust summaries, go back to original

3. **Do personalized learning paths work better than generic?**
   - Test: A/B test personalized vs generic paths
   - Assumption: 2x higher completion rate
   - Risk: Personalization complexity not worth effort

4. **Will users actually follow intent-based paths?**
   - Test: Track path completion for "interview in 2 weeks"
   - Assumption: 60%+ complete suggested path
   - Risk: Users start path but abandon
